Fully responsive basic layout built with pure CSS

Elegant and minimal color scheme suitable for a jewelry brand

Focus on clean structure and semantic HTML

🧠 Purpose

This project was made for study and learning purposes to strengthen my fundamentals in HTML and CSS before moving to advanced tools and frameworks.
